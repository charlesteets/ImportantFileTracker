## Easily keep track of where all the important files on your computer are
  * Bookmark and unmark local files for quick access
  * Make and save notes about files
  * Backup files to another local location or Google Drive
  * Open files using the OS default application
## Installation & Usage
  If you don't want to download and compile the code yourself, you can download the zipped files from my GitHub.

  Alternatively, you can download this entire project and run it through Visual Studio in debug mode and play around with it.
  
  Before running a program on your computer, you should always verify the hash if possible!
